# BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) Threat Hunting Runbook

## 1. Purpose

This runbook provides comprehensive threat hunting methodologies and KQL queries for detecting Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attacks within Microsoft Sentinel environments. The runbook focuses on behavioral indicators, kernel-level activities, and process anomalies associated with malicious driver exploitation techniques commonly used by threat actors including SCATTERED SPIDER, Medusa ransomware, and other advanced persistent threats.

## 2. Threat Context

### Actor Enumeration
- **SCATTERED SPIDER (UNC3944, Octo Tempest, Storm-0875)**: Advanced cybercriminal group targeting telecommunications, BPO, MSSP, and financial services
- **Medusa Ransomware**: Ransomware-as-a-Service operation utilizing ABYSSWORKER driver for EDR evasion
- **Kasseika Ransomware**: Leverages viragt64.sys driver to terminate 991+ security processes
- **Various APT Groups**: Including Lazarus Group (first recorded BYOVD abuse in 2021)

### Motivation
- **Ransomware Deployment**: Disabling security controls for successful encryption operations
- **EDR Evasion**: Bypassing endpoint detection and response solutions
- **Persistence**: Establishing kernel-level persistence mechanisms

- **T1014**: Rootkit (Kernel-level hiding and evasion capabilities)
- **T1553.005**: Subvert Trust Controls - Driver Signature Enforcement Bypass
- **T1003.001**: OS Credential Dumping - LSASS Memory access preparation
- **T1543.003**: Create or Modify System Process - Windows Service (Driver service creation)
- **T1547.006**: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution - Kernel Modules and Extensions
- **T1112**: Modify Registry (Driver configuration and persistence)
- **T1055**: Process Injection (Advanced injection preparation)
- **T1082**: System Information Discovery (Environment analysis)
- **T1518.001**: Software Discovery - Security Software Discovery

## 3. Technical Prerequisites for Threat Hunting

### Required Data Sources
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)**: DeviceProcessEvents, DeviceFileEvents, DeviceRegistryEvents
- **Sysmon**: Process creation, file creation, registry modifications (EventIDs 1, 11, 13)
- **Windows Security Events**: Service installations (EventID 7045), logon events
- **Microsoft Sentinel**: SecurityEvent, DeviceEvents tables

### Required Technologies
- Microsoft Sentinel workspace with MDE connector
- Sysmon deployment for enhanced process monitoring
- Windows Event Logging enabled on critical systems
- Advanced hunting capabilities in Microsoft 365 Defender

## 4. Threat Hunting Hypotheses

### Hunt 1: Enhanced BYOVD Driver Installation Detection

**MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation), T1547.006 (Kernel Modules and Extensions), T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer)

### Hunt 5: Rootkit Behavior Detection via Process Hiding

**MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: T1014 (Rootkit)

**Hypothesis Explanation**: Malicious drivers implement rootkit functionality to hide processes, files, and network connections from security tools.

**Hunting Focus**: Process enumeration discrepancies between different data sources, indicating potential process hiding.

**KQL Query**:
```kql
// Hunt for potential rootkit behavior through process enumeration discrepancies
// Compare process lists from different sources to identify hidden processes
let SysmonProcesses = (
    SecurityEvent
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
    | where EventID == 1  // Sysmon Process Creation

    DiscrepancyPercentage > 50, "Critical",
    DiscrepancyPercentage > 30, "High", 
    "Medium"
)
| order by DiscrepancyPercentage desc
```

**Investigation Steps**:

**KQL Query**:
```kql
// Hunt for fake driver update social engineering campaigns
// Based on Lazarus Group ClickFake campaign observed command pattern
let DriverKeywords = pack_array(
    "nvidia", "nvidiadrivers", "driver", "driverfix", "driverupdate",

    | summarize FileCount = count(), FileNames = make_set(FileName) by DeviceName
) on DeviceName
| project DeviceName, DownloadTime, ThreatScore, AttackChain, FileCount, FileNames
| where ThreatScore >= 8
